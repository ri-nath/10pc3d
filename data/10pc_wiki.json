Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at 4.2465 light-years (1.3020 pc).\n\u03b1 Centauri A and B are Sun-like stars (class G and K, respectively) that together form the binary star system \u03b1 Centauri AB. To the naked eye, these two main components appear to be a single star with an apparent magnitude of \u22120.27 . It is the brightest star in the constellation and the third-brightest in the night sky, outshone by only Sirius and Canopus.\n\u03b1 Centauri A has 1.1 times the mass and 1.5 times the luminosity of the Sun, while \u03b1 Centauri B is smaller and cooler, at 0.9 solar mass and less than 0.5 solar luminosity. The pair orbit around a common centre with an orbital period of 79 years. Their elliptical orbit is eccentric, so that the distance between A and B varies from 35.6 astronomical units (AU), or about the distance between Pluto and the Sun, to 11.2 AU, or about the distance between Saturn and the Sun.\n\u03b1 Centauri C, or Proxima Centauri, is a small faint red dwarf (class M). Though not visible to the naked eye, Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at a distance of 4.24 ly (1.30 pc), slightly closer than \u03b1 Centauri AB. Currently, the distance between Proxima Centauri and \u03b1 Centauri AB is about 13,000 AU (0.21 ly), equivalent to about 430 times the radius of Neptune's orbit.\nProxima Centauri has two confirmed planets: Proxima b, an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone discovered in 2016, and Proxima d, a candidate sub-Earth which orbits very closely to the star, announced in 2022. The existence of Proxima c, a mini-Neptune 1.5 AU away discovered in 2019, is controversial. \u03b1 Centauri A may have a Neptune-sized planet in the habitable zone, though it is not yet known with certainty to be planetary in nature and could be an artifact of the discovery mechanism. \u03b1 Centauri B has no known planets: Planet \u03b1 Cen Bb, purportedly discovered in 2012, was later disproven, and no other planet has yet been confirmed."}, "Barnard's Star": {"title": "Barnard's Star", "summary": "Barnard's Star is a small red dwarf star in the constellation of Ophiuchus.

The star had previously appeared on Harvard University photographic plates in 1888 and 1890.\nBarnard's Star is among the most studied red dwarfs because of its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator. Historically, research on Barnard's Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics, its astrometry, and also refining the limits of possible extrasolar planets. Although Barnard's Star is ancient, it still experiences stellar flare events, one being observed in 1998.\nBarnard's Star has been subject to multiple claims of planets that were later disproven. From the early 1960s to the early 1970s, Peter van de Kamp argued that planets orbited Barnard's Star. His specific claims of large gas giants were refuted in the mid-1970s after much debate. In November 2018, a candidate super-Earth planetary companion known as Barnard's Star b was reported to orbit Barnard's Star. It was believed to have a minimum mass of 3.2 ME and orbit at 0.4 AU.

Sirius is a binary star consisting of a main-sequence star of spectral type A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, termed Sirius B. The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 astronomical units as they orbit every 50 years.\nSirius appears bright because of its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to the Solar System. At a distance of 2.64 parsecs (8.6 ly), the Sirius system is one of Earth's nearest neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System; it is expected to increase in brightness slightly over the next 60,000 years to reach a peak magnitude of \u22121.68.\nCoincidentally, at about the same time, Sirius will take its turn as the southern Pole Star, around the year 66,270 AD. In that year, Sirius will come to within 1.6 degrees of the south celestial pole. This is due to axial precession and proper motion of Sirius itself which moves slowly in the SSW direction, so it will be visible from the southern hemisphere only.\n \nAfter that time, its distance will begin to increase, and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for approximately the next 210,000 years, at which point Vega, another A-type star that is intrinsically more luminous than Sirius, becomes the brightest star.\nSirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun (M\u2609) and has an absolute visual magnitude of +1.43. It is 25 times as luminous as the Sun, but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus, Betelgeuse, or Rigel. The system is between 200 and 300 million years old.

The initially more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its hydrogen fuel and became a red giant before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around 120 million years ago.\nSirius is colloquially known as the \"Dog Star\", reflecting its prominence in its constellation, Canis Major (the Greater Dog).

Number 8760 was assigned to this star in the 1847 edition of Lacaille's catalogue of 9,766 stars by Francis Baily.\nIn the past, Lacaille 8760 has been classified anywhere from spectral class K7 down to M2. In 1979, the Irish astronomer Patrick Byrne discovered that it is a flare star, and it was given the variable star designation AX Microscopii, or AX Mic. As a flare star it is relatively quiescent.\n\nLacaille 8760 is one of the largest and brightest red dwarfs known, with about 60% the mass and 51% the radius of the Sun. It is about five billion years old and is spinning at a projected rotational velocity of 3.3 km/s, giving it a rotation period of roughly 40 days. The star is radiating 7.2% of the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 3,800 K.\nDespite efforts by astronomers, as of 2011 no planets had been detected in orbit around this star.\nLacaille 8760 orbits around the galaxy with a relatively high ellipticity of 0.23. Its closest approach to the Sun occurred about 20,000 years ago when it came within 12 light-years (3.7 parsecs). Due to its low mass (60% of the Sun), it has an expected lifespan of about 75 billion (7.5 \u00d7 1010) years, seven times longer than the Sun's."}, "HD 239960": {"title": "Kruger 60", "summary": "Kr\u00fcger 60 (DO Cephei) is a binary star system located 13.1 light-years (4.0 parsecs) from the Sun.

Newer models of Y dwarfs produce an even colder temperature of 285\u2013305 K for WISE J0336\u22120143 B. WISE 0855\u22120714 remains the coldest object found so far with 225\u2013260 K and WISEA 0830+2837 has a similar temperature with 300\u2013350 K. Models suggest that WISE J0336\u22120143 B might have water clouds, but it is possible that changes in the pressure\u2013temperature profile might instead explain the color of cold Y dwarfs."}, "WISE J064723.23-623235.5": {"title": "WISE 0647\u22126232", "summary": "WISE J064723.23\u2212623235.5 (abbreviated WISE 0647\u22126232) is a nearby brown dwarf of spectral type Y1 \u00b1 0.5, located in constellation Pictor at approximately 32.5 light-years from Earth.

It was formed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is an ordinary main sequence star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. \nThe largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.\nThere is a strong consensus among astronomers that the Solar System has at least eight dwarf planets: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna. There are a vast number of small Solar System bodies, such as asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust clouds. Some of these bodies are in the asteroid belt (between Mars's and Jupiter's orbit) and the Kuiper belt (just outside Neptune's orbit). Six planets, six dwarf planets, and other bodies have orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly called 'moons'.\nThe Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's charged particles, the solar wind, forming the heliosphere. Around 75\u201390 astronomical units from the Sun, the solar wind is halted, resulting in the heliopause. This is the boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space. The outermost region of the Solar System is the theorized Oort cloud, the source for long-period comets, extending to a radius of 2,000\u2013200,000 astronomical units (0.032\u20133.2 light-years). The closest star to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light-years (269,000 AU) away. Both stars belong to the Milky Way galaxy."}}
